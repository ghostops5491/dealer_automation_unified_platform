## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (for local development without Docker):

```env
# Backend
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/crm_db"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="8h"
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend (in frontend/.env)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Local Development (Without Docker)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start PostgreSQL (or use existing)
# Make sure PostgreSQL is running on port 5432

# Terminal 2: Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Edit with your database URL
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run prisma:seed
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Reset Database

```bash
# With Docker
docker-compose down -v  # Removes volumes (database data)
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma db push
docker-compose exec backend npm run prisma:seed

# Without Docker

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Connection refused" on login | Wait 30 seconds after `docker-compose up`, database needs to initialize |
| "Flow not found" when starting form | Make sure you ran the seed command |
| Can't upload files | Check file size (max 4MB) and format (PDF, JPEG, PNG) |
| Insurance Executive can't view forms | Update to latest version - this was fixed |
| Toast messages disappear quickly | They now stay for 3 minutes |

### Check Service Status

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All 3 services should show "Up":
- `crm-postgres`
- `crm-backend`
- `crm-frontend`

### View Detailed Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
docker-compose logs -f postgres
```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs (`docker-compose logs -f`)
2. Make sure all containers are running (`docker-compose ps`)
3. Try resetting the database (see above)
4. Ensure Docker Desktop is running with enough memory (at least 4GB recommended)
